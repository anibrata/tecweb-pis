4. Pair with highest PMI - (milford, haven). 
For this pair the probability of occurence of the pair of the words is comparatively less than the probability of the occurence of the terms individually. Thus these words do not occur very frequently in the collection, and hence there co-occurence carries importance and thus, information. Most probably in this case the words mean together to be the name of some place.
